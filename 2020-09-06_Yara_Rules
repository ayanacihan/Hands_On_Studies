CASE-1: FINDING ANY STRINGS
/*
rule CaseInsensitiveTextExample
{
    strings:
        $text_string = "foobar" nocase

    condition:
        $text_string
}
*/

CASE-2: 1 OR MORE STRINGS AT THE SAME TIME / ONLY 1 OF THEM
/*
rule Example
{
    strings:
        $a = "text1"
        $b = "text2"
        $c = "text3"
        $d = "text4"

    condition:
        ($a or $b) and ($c or $d)
}
*/

ANY OF THEM
rule OfExample4
{
    strings:
        $a = "dummy1"
        $b = "dummy2"
        $c = "dummy3"

    condition:
        1 of them // equivalent to 1 of ($*)
}
In all the examples above, the number of strings have been specified by a numeric constant, but any expression returning a numeric value can be used. The keywords any and all can be used as well.

all of them       // all strings in the rule
any of them       // any string in the rule
all of ($a*)      // all strings whose identifier starts by $a
any of ($a,$b,$c) // any of $a, $b or $c
1 of ($*)         // same that "any of them"
