How do you analyze Phishing E-Mail?
I check if there is any urgency and typo in the mail, I also check if the mail if it is too good to be,
I right-click the email body and see the original email in order to analyze email source.
IP addres, who sent it, is there any links, domain.
If there are any links, I donâ€™t click but I mouse-hover the link and check if it seems legitimite. 
I copy the link and paste into virustotal.com, anyrun.com or any other online sandboxing solutions to see where that URL takes me.
If the link is malicious, I report this mail as a phishing mail. I create ticket.
If there is an attachment to the suspicious mail, I download the file into virtual machine and upload it to virustotal.com. (We can search by its hash as well)
Find out all users that received the email and perform enterprise search to see if any users clicked the attachment/link. (Can we use FireEye HX)
If malicious, perform a whois analysis, find how many domains registered with the mail address.
Inform all users about the fishing email and block all the domains.
